# FoosLeader

This application is developed by employees of HTML24 in Denmark as a tool to keep track of the skill levels in foosball.
Foosball, or table football, or bordfodbold, or Fusball, is a fun little pastime with plastic men on metal sticks 
trying to get a plastic or a cork ball into each other goal. This application does not aim to explain the concept, so
if you do not already know what it is, you would be smart to look it up on the internet. 

This application keeps track of players and uses the ELO ranking system to calculate scores after a result. This 
implementation of ELO scores has worked out quite well in beta testing. It also supports 4 player ELO calculations.

As of writing this application supports registering a match, overall statistics, rival statistics and an overview of
your own accomplishments.  It can also send the updated top 5 or 10 list to an external API that would accept the data
to display somewhere, like on a web page. 

## Planned features

Currently there are plans to add the following features to this system.

* Challenges - challenge a player to a match
* Calculator - view the possible outcome for specific players
* Notifications - view information about relevant events
* Tournaments - Set up a tournament with selected players 

If you have the interest (as well as the skills and the time) to implement one of these features, please feel free
to submit a pull request.

## Contributing 

Everyone is welcome to contribute via pull request on the GitHub repository. 

Everyone is also welcome to create issues of any kind, be it feature request, style change or a bug that by some magic
slipped in there.
